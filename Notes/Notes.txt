1- Refresh token approach for logging in for a while.

2- Blacklisting a token using Redis.

3- When editing a post it requires the whole post to be sent again or the null values will be applied. (consider making separate functions for editing text and photo)

4- Password and username need their own Regex right now you can set them up as anything.
(will delay so it doesn't bother me in testing)

5- Add limiter for the take in the (searchaccounts and getposts) endpoints.
(To prevent overloading the server)

6- Make any function that requires accessing the DB async, so it doesn't stop the server.

7- consider checking for the role of the account from the DB when making a request since the role might have been changed since then.

8- add endpoints to get profile using username.
